Build packages required:
cmake g++ flex bison python tcl

C++ requirements:
The compiler needs to support the TR1 extensions (e.g. shared_ptr<>).  This program compiles successfully with g++ 4.2.1 on Mac OS X.  Older compilers may need the appropriate boost implementations from http://www.boost.org.

Python Requirements:
A version of Python 2.7.3 is recommended.  However, this software should compile and link against previous versions of this software.  This tool has not been tested on Python 3.  Due to Python API inconsitencies, please compile Symdiff for your specific system.  Currently tests are written for Python 2.6, but may use Python 2.7.3 language features.

Tcl Requirements:
Any version of Tcl of 8.4 and above should work.  In principle, Symdiff libraries may be used across Tcl versions, because of the consistent API.  Currently tests are written for Tcl 8.5.

Mac OS X:
Mac OS X developer tools are required.
Modify scripts/setup_apple.sh as necessary for your configuration and run from the base directory of this project.
cd osx_release
make -j2

Linux:
Modify scripts/setup_linux.sh as necessary for your configuration and run from the base directory of this project.

Then go into the appropriate directory to build:
cd linux_x86_64_release
make -j2

Windows:
Windows is not set up for the new cmake configuration.  In principle it should work.

Running the tests:
make test

To run on your scripts go into the bin directory
symdiff for python
symdiff_tcl for tclsh

These set up the appropriate environment for loading SYMDIFF into your intepreter.

Documentation is in the doc directory.  Examples are in the examples and testing directory.
