Build packages required:
cmake g++ flex bison python tcl

C++ requirements:
The compiler needs to support the TR1 extensions (e.g. shared_ptr<>).  
This program compiles successfully with g++ 4.2.1 on Mac OS X.  Older 
compilers may need the appropriate boost implementations from 
http://www.boost.org.

Python Requirements:
A version of Python 2.7.3 is recommended.  However, this software 
should compile and link against previous versions of this software.  
This tool has not been tested on Python 3.  Due to Python API 
inconsistencies, please compile Symdiff for your specific system.  
Currently tests are written for Python 2.6, but may use Python 2.7.3 
language features in the future.

Tcl Requirements:
Any version of Tcl of 8.4 and above should work.  In principle, Symdiff 
libraries may be used across Tcl versions, because of the consistent 
API.  Currently tests are written for Tcl 8.5.

Mac OS X:
Mac OS X developer tools are required.
Modify scripts/setup_apple.sh as necessary for your configuration and 
run from the base directory of this project.
The file scripts/setup_osx_10.6.8.sh is also available for OS X version 
10.6.8.  Use "sw_vers -productVersion" to determine your OS X version.
cd osx_release
make -j2

Linux:
Modify scripts/setup_linux.sh as necessary for your configuration and 
run from the base directory of this project.  Ubuntu scripts are 
available for the last two LTS releases:
scripts/setup_ubuntu_10.04.sh
scripts/setup_ubuntu_12.04.sh

Then go into the appropriate directory to build:
cd linux_x86_64_release
make -j2

Windows:
Windows is not set up for the new cmake configuration, so modifications 
will need to be made to get this to work.

Running the tests:
make test

To run on your scripts go into the bin directory
symdiff for python
symdiff_tcl for tclsh

These set up the appropriate environment for loading SYMDIFF into your 
intepreter.

Documentation is in the doc directory.  Examples are in the examples 
and testing directory.
